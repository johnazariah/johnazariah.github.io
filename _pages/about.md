I'm John Azariah, a software developer with a passion for functional programming, type theory, and the art of building elegant software.

## Interests

- **Functional Programming**: F#, Haskell, and the joy of pure functions
- **Type Theory**: Exploring the boundaries of what types can express
- **Python**: Making it more functional, one decorator at a time
- **Programming Languages**: The craft of language design and implementation
- **Mathematics in Computing**: Lambda calculus, category theory, and formal methods

## This Blog

Here I share my explorations and discoveries in programming. Whether it's deriving the Y-combinator from first principles, building DSLs with tagless-final encoding, or making Python more pythonic (and more functional), I aim to make complex topics accessible without sacrificing depth.
